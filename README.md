# Tutorials

## General Notes

These tutorials focus on the usage of **Jexxa**.  
The included business logic has no special meaning but is based on typical scenarios from business applications that can easily be transferred to other domains.

We assume you have a basic understanding of:
* **Java programming** and building applications with **Maven**
* (Optional) some initial experience with **databases** and **message buses**
* (Optional) a first idea of the **ports and adapters architecture** (see [this article](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/))

### Additional Information
* To implement the tutorials yourself, you can use the [`jexxa-blank-archetype`](https://github.com/jexxa-projects/JexxaArchetypes) to generate a project skeleton.
* All tutorials run by default without requiring additional infrastructure services such as a message bus or database.
* If you just want to **run the tutorials**, you can use:
    * Prebuilt Docker images available [here](https://github.com/orgs/jexxa-projects/packages?repo_name=JexxaTutorials)
    * Docker stacks for each tutorial:
        * [HelloJexxa](deploy/hellojexxa-compose.yml)
        * [TimeService](deploy/timeservice-compose.yml)
        * [BookStore](deploy/bookstore-compose.yml)
        * [ContractManagement](deploy/contract-management-compose.yml)
* If you want to **build the tutorials locally**, make sure you have a running [developer stack](deploy/developerStack.yml), which provides:
    * a Postgres database
    * an ActiveMQ broker
    * Swagger-UI to access these applications
