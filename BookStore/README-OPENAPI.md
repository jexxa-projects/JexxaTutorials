## What You Learn

*   [How to enable OpenAPI support for an application](#Enable-OpenAPI) 
*   [How to explore OpenAPI for your application](#Explore-OpenAPI)        

## What you need

*   Understand tutorial [`BookStore - Using a Repository`](README.md) because we explain only new aspects 
*   30 minutes
*   JDK 17 (or higher) installed
*   [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)    
*   Maven 3.6 (or higher) installed
*   A postgres DB (if you start the application with running infrastructure)  

## Enable OpenAPI  

In general OpenAPI support can be enabled for all objects that can be accessed via the `RESTfulRPCAdapter`. 
To enable OpenAPI support, you just need to define an OpenAPI-path either in the properties or when starting the application. 
The corresponding parameter is `io.jexxa.rest.openapi.path`.

```console                                                          
mvn clean install
java -jar "-Dio.jexxa.config.import=./src/test/resources/jexxa-test.properties" target/bookstore-jar-with-dependencies.jar```
You will see following (or similar) output
```console
...
[main] INFO io.jexxa.utils.JexxaBanner - Access Information: 
[main] INFO io.jexxa.utils.JexxaBanner - Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7503
[main] INFO io.jexxa.utils.JexxaBanner - OpenAPI available at: http://0.0.0.0:7503/swagger-docs/swagger.json


```          

## Explore OpenAPI

You can use [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) to explore the documentation. Just start Swagger UI, enter the URL and press explore button. 

Note: In case you start Swagger UI not on the same machine as your BookStore-application, or from a docker image you have to use the public IP address of the machine running BookStore-application. 

As result, you should get following overview with available operations: 

![OpenAPI-Docu](images/OpenAPI-Docu.png) 

Now, lets start execute some methods.
       
### Get list of books

To get a list of available books, you first have to select the corresponding methods. As soon as you pressed it, you will get detailed information such as including parameters and responses. 

![OpenAPI-getBooks](images/OpenAPI-getBooks.png) 

Now, you can execute the method `getBooks` and Swagger-UI will show you all available books. 

![OpenAPI-getBooksResult](images/OpenAPI-getBooksResult.png) 

From these results you can play around with remaining methods provided by this application. 

Thatâ€™s it!
